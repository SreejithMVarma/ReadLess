# ReadLess - Chat-based URL Research Tool

A powerful Streamlit application that simplifies research by transforming URLs into insightful and contextual chat interactions. This tool leverages LangChain, FAISS, Hugging Face embeddings, and Google Generative AI for efficient data retrieval and conversational outputs.

## Features

- **Multi-URL Input**: Add up to three URLs for processing simultaneously.
- **Unstructured Data Parsing**: Handles raw web content and converts it into meaningful chunks.
- **Embeddings with FAISS**: Efficiently indexes document embeddings for fast retrieval.
- **Chat Interface**: Query processed data through an intuitive chat interface.
- **Contextual AI Responses**: Powered by Google's Gemini for relevant and accurate answers.
- **Source Attribution**: Provides sources for retrieved answers to ensure reliability.
