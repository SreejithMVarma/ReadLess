# _READ LESS_ - chat, search, and save time - no more endless reading!

A powerful Streamlit application designed to simplify research by transforming URLs into insightful and contextual chat interactions. This tool leverages LangChain, FAISS, Hugging Face embeddings, Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash), and other technologies for efficient data retrieval and conversational outputs.

## Features

- **Multi-URL Input**: Input up to three URLs for processing simultaneously.
- **Unstructured Data Parsing**: Extracts raw web content and converts it into meaningful chunks.
- **Embeddings with FAISS**: Efficiently indexes document embeddings for fast retrieval.
- **Chat Interface**: Engage with processed data through an intuitive chat interface.
- **Contextual AI Responses**: Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash for relevant and accurate answers.
- **Source Attribution**: Provides sources for the answers to ensure reliability and transparency.
